Apoorvaa has created an elevated roof. She wants to know how much water can she save during rain.

Given n non negative integers representing the elevation map where width of every bar is 1, Find the maximum water that she can save.

Explanation for the Sample input Testcase:
Elevation Map

So the total units of water she can save is 5 units

Input Format
First line contains an integer n. Second line contains n space separated integers representing the elevation map.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^6

Output Format
Print a single integer containing the maximum unit of waters she can save.

Sample Input
10
0 2 1 3 0 1 2 1 2 1
Sample Output
5
Explanation
Refer to the image for explanation. Count the number of cells having water in them.

//Program

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int findWater(int arr[], int n)
{
    int left[n];

    int right[n];
 
    int water = 0;
 
    left[0] = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        left[i] = max(left[i - 1], arr[i]);

    right[n - 1] = arr[n - 1];
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)
        right[i] = max(right[i + 1], arr[i]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        water += min(left[i], right[i]) - arr[i];
 
    return water;
