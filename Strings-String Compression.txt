Take as input S, a string. Write a function that does basic string compression. Print the value returned. E.g. for input “aaabbccds” print out a3b2c2ds.

Input Format
A single String S.

Constraints
A string of length between 1 to 1000

Output Format
The compressed String.

Sample Input
aaabbccds
Sample Output
a3b2c2ds
Explanation
In the given sample test case 'a' is repeated 3 times consecutively, 'b' is repeated twice, 'c' is repeated twice. But, 'd' and 's' occurred only once that's why we do not write their occurrence.

//Program

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	string str;
	getline(cin,str);
	int i=0,occurance=1;
	while(str[i]!='\0')
	{
		if(str[i]==str[i+1])
		{
			occurance++;
		}
		else
		{
			if(occurance!=1)
			{
				cout<<str[i]<<occurance;
			}
			else
			{
				cout<<str[i];
			}
			occurance=1;	
		}
		i++;
	}
	return 0;
}
